   ISR performance, interrupt latency  DUE (84Mhz), maple(72Mhz), teensy3(96MHz)
    measure ticks for back-to-back calls to systick, ticks for fast pin set,
      ticks for digtalWrite.  Measure time to get into and out of ISR from
      standard (std) attachInterrupt() to modfied kernel ISR (opt)
