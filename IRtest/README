IRremote  IR TV remote transmit and receiver proof of concept
  
  -needs to be rolled into IRremote  library

for DUE, 
   pin 8 has IR receiver (Sharp GP1UX311QS), sampled every 50us (TC1 chan 0)
   uses PWM on pin 6 to transmit via IR LED at 38khz to 40khz
    IR LED 940nm forward v: 1.2v, pin 6 can source 15 ma, need 140ohm resistor
	  (though I used 100 ohm, figuring PWM would lessen load), for more
	  power you'd need transistor.
	  you can "see" IR LED with digital camera

                 with LED right next to receiver on breadboard, sketch can 
				 receieve its own transmits
